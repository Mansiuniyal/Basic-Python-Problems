**AGE DETECTOR PROBLEM**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT -**
Take age or year of birth as an input from the user. Store the input in one variable. 
Your program should detect whether the entered input is age or year of birth and tell the user when they will turn 100 years old.

Program should also tell the age of the user in a particular year they have entered.

**Here are a few instructions to follow:**

-Do not use any type of module like DateTime or date utils. 

-Users can optionally provide a year, and program must tell their age in that particular year. 

-code should handle all sorts of errors like:  

You are not yet born

You seem to be the oldest person alive
