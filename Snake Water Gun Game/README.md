This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer

Following are the rules of the game:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.

Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water

Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

There is a usage of random.choice() method and nested if-else statements to select a random item from a list.
